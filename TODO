Improvements
=====
- Better offset lookup, especially in shared memory case.
- GCC intrinsics for shared-memory atomics.
- Shared-memory optimizations for strided.
- Use overlapping windows to get intranode optimizations in the general case.
- Large-count support via datatypes (expected to work in MPICH soon).
